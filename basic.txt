Firstly, to learn the basic things about the git hub repository download the git 
link: https://git-scm.com/download/win
when u visit this site download will be automatically generated.

Then, create a folder in your desktop like "basic"
and open this folder in 'Git Bash Here'.
now you are able to learn git cli.

type:
 git --version > it shows ur git version
 git init    > it shows the git repository in ur current folder means "basic"[if not any it shows - 
cli:
mdala@DESKTOP-125MBG8 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Basic
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/mdala/Desktop/Basic/.git/
]

git status > it shows about branch master, no of commits, tracked and untracked files info.

now let's create a file in basic folder:

just using touch like ubuntu(debian)

touch basic.txt > it creates a basic.txt file in that folder.
To check about this folder just type
git status > it shows the file info. in that folder (basic)
cli:
mdala@DESKTOP-125MBG8 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Basic (master)
$ touch basic.txt

mdala@DESKTOP-125MBG8 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Basic (master)
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        basic.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

now to push this in the git hub do things things:

type : git add . > it add all the files in that folder to track ( to push/commit)
[if u want to do for a specific file then type that file name like :
 git add basic.hmtl  ( here basic.html is a file )]

now for commit first type:
git commit -am 'basic'  [ basic is the folder name]

now create a repository in a github file name as the folder name like 'basic'
